# ProjectDevelopmentINFO2300A1
This is the website I have made as a project for my Course in the 5th semester. This is a website related to halloween.
This website can be acccessed by [Clicking Here](https://aakashdeepwahi.github.io/ProjectDevelopmentINFO2300A1). So that you guys can enjoy our spooky theme. Here is a quiz that you can access in it with some dangerous sound. I request that heart patients please lower the volume while playing. One can play this quiz game over the phone, laptop and tablet.

It doesn't need any application to be installed in that.
